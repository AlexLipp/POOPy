    "The intended way to access active EDM data is by instantiating a `WaterCompany` object, which corresponds to the EDM sensor network maintained by a specific water comapny. When initialising the object, it is populated with all of the active (i.e., _transmitting_) EDM monitors maintained by Thames Water. However, we do not create a `WaterCompany` object directly. Instead, each water company defines a sub-class of a `WaterCompany` object. This is because each company transmits their data via different APIs and so the data is accessed in slightly different ways. However, this is all done 'behind the scenes', so they are all interacted with in the exact same way. The only difference is the name of the class. Lets have a look at the data in Thames Water's active EDM monitors...\n",
