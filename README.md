## Description

This is a Python package for interfacing with Event Duration Monitoring (EDM) devices maintained by English (and Welsh!) Water Companies. This package was ostensibly developed to provide the back-end for [SewageMap.co.uk](https://github.com/AlexLipp/thames-sewage) but may be generically useful for those exploring the impact of sewage discharges on rivers. Currently, `POOPy` supports data from the following water companies: 
- [Thames Water](https://github.com/AlexLipp/POOPy/blob/main/poopy/companies.py#L13)
- [Welsh Water/DÅµr Cymru](https://github.com/AlexLipp/POOPy/blob/main/poopy/companies.py#L511)

It can be used, for example to make figures like...

... this one showing the stretches of the Thames downstream of active sewage discharges at the shown time...

...or this one which shows the discharge history of a specific monitor...

...or this one which shows the number of live monitors deployed by Thames Water through time and whether they were discharging...

## Installation

Install this package by running the following command (replacing `[LOCAL DIRECTORY]` with the directory you wish to install the package into).


```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexLipp/POOPy.git [LOCAL DIRECTORY]
pip install .
```

### Dependencies

The package requires standard scientific Python packages (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`) as well as the following packages:

- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html) - Required to manipulate geospatial datasets.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - For running the test suite [_optional_, see [Testing](#testing)].
### API Keys

To access the data for the following water companies, you will need to obtain API keys from the relevant water company by registering with their developer portal: 

- [Thames Water](https://data.thameswater.co.uk/s/)

From these portals you will obtain `client_id` and `client_secret` keys which are required to access the datasets. `POOPy` will look for these keys in the _environment variables_ of your system. Specifically, it will look for the following variables which must be set in your system environment: 

| Key                        | Environment Variable  |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Thames Water client ID  | `TW_CLIENT_ID`        |
| Thames Water 'secret' ID  | `TW_CLIENT_SECRET`    |

How to set these environment variables will depend on your operating system. For example, on a Unix-based system, you could add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file: 

```bash
export TW_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export TW_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
```

### Testing 

A test script is provided in the `tests` folder. To run the tests, you will need to install the [`pytest` package](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). If installed, the tests can be run from the command line by navigating to the folder in which the package is installed and simply running the command: 

```bash
pytest
```
This will run the tests and provide a summary of the results. If all tests pass, the package has been installed correctly and behaving as expected. 


## Usage

Once installed, the package can be imported into Python scripts using standard import commands, such as:
```python
import poopy
```
or 
```python
from poopy.companies import ThamesWater
```

### Examples

Examples of how to use the package (using the `ThamesWater` class as an example) are given in the `examples` folder in the form of interactive python Jupyter noteboooks: 
- [Investigating the *current* status of sewer overflow spilling](https://github.com/AlexLipp/POOPy/blob/main/examples/current_status.ipynb)
- [Investigating the *historical* status of sewer overflow spilling](https://github.com/AlexLipp/POOPy/blob/main/examples/historical_status.ipynb)
