    at a node and ends at a bifurcation or dead end. Each segment contains first the start node and then all nodes upstream of it
    in the order they are visited. The segments are ordered topologically, so that the first segment in the list
    is base-level, and the last segment in the list is an upstream tributary. Base level nodes present an edge case, and as such
